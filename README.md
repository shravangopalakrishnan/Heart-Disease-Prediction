# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Teammate: Vinaya Ramamorthy Venkatasubramanian (https://github.com/Vinayavenkat)

One of the primary causes of death in the modern world has always been heart disease. The detection of cardiovascular disease is a significant obstacle in clinical data analysis. Machine learning (ML) is renowned to be a powerful tool for forecasting and making decisions in the healthcare sector, due to the enormous amount of data that is generated. Implement- ing various techniques, such as Naive Bayes Classifier, KNN, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression, the proposed work predicts the likelihood of heart disease. This project aims at finding the most efficient algorithm in predicting the occurrence of heart disease in people. Unlike other existing approaches that have faced considerable shortcomings in implementations and expected outcomes, we plan to follow a conventional and analytical approach with refined datasets. The outcomes are mostly either positive or negative, positive being the sign that the patient needs to get themself diagnosed for heart disease, and negative showing that the patient doesnâ€™t need a diagnosis. This project helps us significantly in figuring out the characteristics that are most crucial for a positive or negative diagnosis of heart disease.
